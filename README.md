Heart Disease EDA &amp; Modeling

# Goals
In this project we want to look at heart disease reporting data, and figure out which variable is most related to heart disease. 

# Why?
Heart disease is, and remains the #1 cause of death in the United States.  Predicting ways to decrease heart disease in even a fraction of patients
has the promsie to save millions of dollaes in insurance claims.
